      I'm going through a really rough breakup right now and could use some advice. My partner of 3 years just ended things with me last week and I'm having trouble coping. I know I messed up badly -- I cheated on them about 2 months ago with someone from work. They found out through a mutual friend and immediately broke up with me. I feel incredibly guilty about what I did and I know I deserve this, but I can't stop thinking about them. How do I move on from this?

      I'm sorry you're going through this difficult time. Breakups are painful, and when they involve betrayal, the emotional complexity can be even more challenging to navigate. Here are some thoughts on how to move forward:

      First, it's important to acknowledge what you're experiencing. You're dealing with multiple layers of grief -- the loss of the relationship, guilt over your actions, and perhaps regret about choices made. These feelings are valid, even if the situation was partly of your own making.

      Moving forward requires both self-compassion and accountability. Self-compassion doesn't mean excusing what happened, but rather recognizing that you're human and capable of making mistakes. At the same time, use this as an opportunity for genuine reflection. What led to the decision to cheat? Were there unaddressed issues in the relationship, or patterns in your own behavior that need attention?

      Consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can help you process both the grief of the breakup and the underlying factors that contributed to your choices. This kind of professional guidance can be invaluable in preventing similar patterns in future relationships.

      For now, focus on basic self-care. Maintain routines, stay connected with supportive friends and family, exercise, and give yourself time to heal. Avoid the temptation to immediately jump into another relationship or to numb the pain through unhealthy coping mechanisms.

      Finally, respect your ex-partner's decision and space. If they don't want contact, honor that boundary. The best thing you can do now is work on becoming someone who won't make the same mistakes again.

      Thank you, that's helpful. I've been thinking about therapy but wasn't sure if it was "serious enough" to warrant it. I guess my biggest struggle is that I still love them and keep hoping they'll forgive me and take me back. Is that realistic, or am I just torturing myself?

      Whether reconciliation is realistic depends on many factors that only your ex-partner can really answer -- and honestly, you may not get that answer for some time, if ever. What I can tell you is that hoping for reconciliation while making it the center of your healing process is likely to prolong your pain.

      Here's the difficult truth: you cannot control whether they forgive you or take you back. You can only control your own actions and growth. If you spend all your energy hoping and waiting, you're putting your life on hold for an outcome that may never come. That's not fair to you, and paradoxically, it's also not the best foundation if reconciliation were to happen.

      Instead, I'd suggest reframing your focus. Rather than "will they take me back?", ask yourself "what kind of person do I want to become?" Work on yourself not as a strategy to win them back, but because you genuinely want to be better. If reconciliation happens someday, it should be between two people who have both grown and healed, not because one person waited desperately while the other felt pressured.

      Regarding therapy -- yes, this is absolutely "serious enough." You're dealing with relationship trauma, guilt, patterns of behavior that led to choices you regret, and grief. These are exactly the kinds of issues therapy is designed to help with. You don't need to wait until you're in crisis to seek support. Think of therapy as maintenance and growth, not just emergency intervention.

      Give yourself permission to grieve fully, to work on yourself genuinely, and to move forward -- even if that means accepting that this relationship may be over permanently.
