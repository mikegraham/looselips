      I've been dealing with flat feet my whole life and I'm finally looking into
      custom orthotics. My podiatrist recommended them but I'm not sure what to
      expect. How does the fitting process work?

      Custom orthotics can make a huge difference for flat feet! The fitting process
      typically involves several steps:

      First, your podiatrist will do a thorough biomechanical assessment of your feet
      and gait. They'll look at how you walk, where pressure points are, and measure
      the degree of arch collapse. Many offices now use 3D scanning technology or foam
      impressions to create a precise mold of your feet.

      The orthotics are then custom-manufactured based on these measurements, usually
      taking 2-3 weeks. They're designed to support your arch, redistribute pressure,
      and correct alignment issues. Most people start wearing them gradually -- a few
      hours per day at first, then building up to full-time wear.

      You'll likely have a follow-up appointment to check the fit and make any needed
      adjustments. It's normal to need some fine-tuning initially.

      That's helpful, thanks. One thing I'm wondering about -- will I need to size
      up my regular shoes to accommodate the orthotics, or do they fit in my normal
      size? Also asking for a friend who wears size 17 -- he's been putting off
      getting orthotics because he already has trouble finding shoes that fit.
  - assistant: |
      Great question! Whether you need to size up depends on the orthotic thickness
      and your current shoes' removable insoles.

      Most custom orthotics are designed to replace the existing insole, not sit on
      top of it. So you'd remove the factory insole and put the orthotic in its place.
      In most cases your current shoe size should still fit fine. However, orthotics
      are often thicker and more supportive than standard insoles, especially in the
      arch area. For dress shoes or shoes with glued-in insoles, you might need a half
      size larger or to look for styles with more depth in the toe box.

      For your friend at size 17, orthotics are actually even more important -- larger
      feet put more stress on the arch and plantar fascia. The challenge is that
      extended-size shoes already have limited options, and adding orthotics can make
      the fit tighter. Tell him to look for brands with removable insoles (New Balance,
      Brooks, ASICS all go up to 16-17 in many models). Custom orthotics are made to
      his exact foot mold, so they'll fit the shoe's footbed precisely -- it's the
      generic insoles that cause problems.

      My advice for both of you: bring a few pairs of your most-worn shoes to the
      fitting appointment. The podiatrist can test the orthotics in each pair and
      give specific guidance on what will work.

      Perfect, I'll bring my running shoes and work boots to the appointment. One
      last question -- how long do these usually last before needing replacement?
  - assistant: |
      The lifespan of custom orthotics varies based on materials, activity level, and
      body weight, but most last 3-5 years with proper care.

      If you're very active -- running regularly, working on your feet all day --
      you might see wear closer to the 2-3 year mark. The materials compress over time
      and lose some of their supportive properties. Signs it's time for replacement
      include visible wear patterns, cracks in the material, or a return of the foot
      pain that the orthotics originally resolved.

      Many podiatrists recommend annual check-ups to assess wear and make sure your
      biomechanics haven't changed. Sometimes minor adjustments can extend the life
      of your current pair.

      Also worth noting: some insurance plans will cover replacement orthotics every
      few years, so check your benefits. Keep your orthotics clean and dry, and they'll
      serve you well for years.
