      I have an old misdemeanor shoplifting conviction from about 7 years ago.
      I'm trying to get my life together and it keeps coming up on background checks.

      How does expungement usually work and what should I do first?
  - assistant: |
      I am not a lawyer, but I can explain common expungement patterns and a practical first-step checklist. The specifics vary a lot by state.

      How expungement "usually" works (high level)
      - Eligibility depends on:
        - offense type (some are excluded)
        - time since conviction or completion of sentence
        - whether you had other convictions since
        - whether all fines/probation/community service were completed
      - The process often involves:
        - getting your case records
        - filing a petition/motion
        - serving notice to the prosecutor (sometimes)
        - a hearing (sometimes)
        - an order from the court if approved

      What to do first (practical checklist)
      1) Identify jurisdiction and exact charge
      - County/state where it happened
      - Statute number or charge name matters for eligibility

      2) Pull your records
      - Court docket and disposition
      - Proof of completion (probation end, fees paid)
      - Any certificates if you did programs

      3) Check your state's eligibility rules
      - Look for "expungement", "record sealing", and "set aside" (these can differ)
      - Many places have waiting periods (ex: X years after completion)

      4) Decide whether to DIY or use help
      - DIY can work for straightforward misdemeanors if your state has forms and clear guidance.
      - If your case is complex (multiple cases, missed payments, probation violations), a lawyer or legal aid clinic can save time and reduce denials.

      5) Be realistic about outcomes
      - Some outcomes are sealing (hidden from most employers) rather than total deletion.
      - Some agencies (law enforcement, certain licenses) may still see it.

      If you tell me your state (only the state, not your address), I can point you to the typical terminology and steps used there.

      I'm in California.
      Also, what do I say on job applications while I'm in the middle of this?
  - assistant: |
      In California, terminology and rules can be specific (and they change), so it is worth checking current official guidance or speaking with a legal aid clinic.

      What to say on job applications (general approach)
      - Be truthful. Do not claim something is expunged/sealed until it actually is.
      - Read the question carefully:
        - Some ask about "convictions" generally.
        - Some ask only about certain types of convictions, or within a time window.
        - Some applications (especially for regulated roles) have broader disclosure requirements.

      Practical wording strategies (without oversharing)
      - If asked and you must disclose:
        - "Misdemeanor conviction from 2018. Since then: stable employment, no further issues, and I have taken steps to address it, including pursuing record relief."
      - Keep it short:
        - Do not add details that were not asked (store name, dollar amount, etc.).
      - In interviews:
        - Acknowledge, emphasize time elapsed and changes, and pivot to current reliability.

      Where to get targeted help in California
      - County legal aid organizations often have expungement/record relief clinics.
      - Some counties provide self-help court resources.

      If you share the exact wording of the application question (copy/paste), I can help you interpret what it is asking and draft a concise, compliant answer.
  - user: |
      The question says: "Have you ever been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony?"
      It does not mention any exceptions.
  - assistant: |
      With that exact wording, the safest general guidance is:
      - If you have a misdemeanor conviction, that question is asking for disclosure.

      A concise disclosure that avoids unnecessary detail
      - "Yes. Misdemeanor conviction in 2018. I have had no subsequent offenses and have taken steps toward record relief. I am happy to discuss the circumstances and what I have done since."

      If there is a text box, keep it to 1-2 sentences.
      If there is no box and it is just a checkbox, answer "Yes" and be prepared with a brief explanation if asked later.

      Also consider:
      - Some employers run background checks after a conditional offer; your disclosure can prevent surprise.
      - For regulated or licensed positions, consult a legal aid clinic or attorney because disclosure rules can be stricter.

      If you want, paste the job type (ex: warehouse, office admin, healthcare) and I can suggest how to frame the explanation to match what employers in that area typically care about (honesty, reliability, time elapsed, and evidence of change).
