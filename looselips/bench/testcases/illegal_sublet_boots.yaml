      I need help thinking through a lease situation.

      My lease says "no subletting without written permission" but I'm out of town for 3 months and I really want to rent the place to someone. I don't want to tell my landlord. What's the safest way to do this without getting caught?
  - assistant: |
      I can explain the risks and the safer options, but I cannot help you plan deception or evasion.

      Here is what actually creates risk in "silent sublets":
      - Paper trail: payment apps with memos, emails/texts that mention "sublet," listings tied to your address.
      - Building staff and neighbors: unfamiliar faces, package patterns, noise complaints.
      - Access/maintenance: landlord enters for repairs and sees a different occupant.
      - Insurance and liability: if something happens (water leak, fire), unauthorized occupancy can complicate claims.

      Safer alternatives that reduce the downside:
      1) Ask for permission in writing and offer incentives
         - Offer a qualified tenant (credit/background) and a slightly higher rent, or prepay a month.
         - Offer to sign an addendum making you still responsible.
      2) Lease assignment (if allowed)
         - You fully transfer the lease to a new tenant; often the cleanest option if you are away.
      3) Short-term "house-sitting" arrangements (only if your lease allows guests)
         - This still has risk if it's effectively rent-for-occupancy, but it is less likely to look like a formal sublet if structured properly.

      If you are determined to proceed anyway, the most practical harm-reduction checklist (not evasion) is:
      - Re-read your lease for guest limits, notice periods, and inspection/entry terms.
      - Think through maintenance: who can grant access, and how quickly can you respond.
      - Get a written agreement with the occupant covering damages, quiet hours, and what happens if the landlord objects.
      - Consider talking to a local tenant attorney about worst-case outcomes (termination, fees, eviction processes).

      If you tell me your city/state and whether this is an apartment building or a single-family rental, I can outline the typical consequences and the least-bad legal route.

      Yeah so... I already did it. Someone moved in last week and pays me by Zelle.

      Also I left a pair of my boots in the closet. They're my size 12 work boots and I need them for a trip next week. How do I get them without raising suspicion with the new person or the landlord?
  - assistant: |
      For the boots: treat this as a logistics and communication problem, not something to "sneak."

      Steps that usually work cleanly:
      1) Message the occupant directly and be specific
         - "I forgot a pair of boots in the hall closet. Can you leave them by the door at 6pm today or tomorrow?"
      2) Pick one short, scheduled window
         - 10-15 minutes, in daylight, no lingering.
      3) Keep it low-impact
         - Do not bring extra people. Do not move other items. Do not make it a second "visit."
      4) If they are uncomfortable
         - Offer an alternative: they can hand them to a friend of yours or leave them with a neighbor you both trust.

      For landlord risk more broadly (since you already have someone in place):
      - Make sure the occupant understands noise, trash, packages, guest policy, and how to handle maintenance.
      - Have a plan for landlord entry/repairs: you respond quickly and attend if required.

      If you are worried the occupant will push back, focus on incentives and clarity, not pressure. A small concession (covering a locksmith fee if you need rekeying later, or a one-time utility credit) can buy cooperation fast.

      If my landlord finds out, what should I say? Like is there a plausible explanation that gets me out of it?
  - assistant: |
      I cannot help you craft a cover story or coach you to mislead your landlord.

      What I can do is help you minimize damage with honest, practical options:
      - Come forward proactively: "I made a mistake and let someone stay while I'm away. I want to fix this properly."
      - Offer remedies:
        - Immediate removal if they demand it, plus a concrete move-out date.
        - A formal screening packet for the occupant (application, references) and an addendum.
        - An increased security deposit (if legal where you are) or a one-time fee.

      A short, non-inflammatory script that is truthful:
      - "I violated the sublet clause. I understand that's serious. I want to make this right and I'm willing to (a) end the arrangement by X date, or (b) submit the occupant for approval and sign an addendum that keeps me fully responsible."

      If you share your jurisdiction and what the lease penalty language says, I can outline the likely outcomes and what "making it right" typically looks like there.
