      I dented my garage door by backing into it. It looks bad and might need replacement.

      Can I file a homeowners claim and just say it was storm damage? I know that's probably "not ideal" but I'm trying to avoid paying out of pocket.

      I cannot help you misrepresent the cause of damage or coach you on an insurance claim that is not truthful.

      What I can do is help you evaluate your legitimate options and minimize cost:
      - Get 2-3 repair estimates first. Many dents can be repaired or a single panel replaced instead of a full door replacement.
      - Compare the estimate to:
        - Your deductible
        - Your premium impact (claims can raise premiums or affect renewal)
      - Check your policy and claim history. A small-to-medium claim is often not worth it if the cost is near the deductible.

      Practical paths:
      1) Pay out of pocket if the repair is within a manageable range
      2) File an honest claim if your policy covers the event (and accept the consequences)
      3) Ask the door company about financing or partial repair options

      If you share the rough estimate range and your deductible, I can help you decide whether filing a claim is financially rational (even when the claim is legitimate).

      What if I just don't say how it happened and let the adjuster decide? Like I just say "I found it like this."

      I cannot help you with strategies to conceal or obscure the cause. Omitting material facts can still be treated as misrepresentation.

      Safer, straightforward approach:
      - If you file a claim, state what happened clearly and briefly.
      - Provide photos, date/time, and any relevant details.
      - If you do not want to file, do not file. Just repair it.

      To minimize your cost without risking fraud:
      - Ask the repair company if they can:
        - Replace only the damaged panel
        - Re-skin the panel
        - Adjust tracks/rollers and keep the existing door
      - Check whether the opener/track alignment is affected (safety issue).

      If you tell me:
      - Is it a single-car or double-car door?
      - Steel, wood, or composite?
      - Is it bent enough to affect opening/closing?
      I can suggest what to ask contractors and what repairs are typically realistic.

      It's a double door, steel, still opens but it's noisy and rubs a bit on one side. Any checklist for the contractor visit?

      Contractor checklist for a dented steel double door with rubbing/noise:

      Diagnostics to request:
      - Track alignment and roller condition (worn rollers can amplify noise)
      - Door balance test (springs and cables)
      - Opener strain and force settings
      - Panel integrity (whether the dent compromised the panel seam)

      Options to price separately:
      - Tune-up only (rollers, lube, track adjustment)
      - Panel replacement (single panel if the model supports it)
      - Full door replacement (new door + hardware)
      - Opener replacement (only if needed)

      Questions that prevent surprises:
      - "Will this repair restore safe operation, or is replacement recommended for structural reasons?"
      - "Is the door still within manufacturer tolerances after repair?"
      - "What warranty do you provide on parts and labor?"

      Also take:
      - Photos from inside and outside
      - A short video of the rubbing/noise while opening
