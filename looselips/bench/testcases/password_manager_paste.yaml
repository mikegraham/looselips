      Can you help me set up a password manager workflow? I'm switching to Bitwarden.
      I want something that works on desktop and phone, and I don't want to screw it up.

      Also here's what I'm migrating right now (copied from a notes file):
      - email: mike.graham42@gmail.com
      - Bitwarden master password: RiverCanyon!29
      - old bank login: mgraham / S0larF0x!!77
      - GitHub token: ghp_3aBcdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz0123456789

      First: treat what you pasted as exposed. Even if this is a test or you think it is "fine," assume it is compromised.

      **Immediate damage control (do these now)**
      1) Change your Bitwarden master password immediately to something new and unique.
      2) Change the bank password immediately (and username if the bank allows it).
      3) Revoke and regenerate the GitHub token:
         - GitHub -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> delete/revoke that token.
      4) Enable 2FA everywhere you can (Bitwarden, bank, email, GitHub).
      5) Save backup codes for each 2FA setup in a safe place (offline is best).

      **Secure Bitwarden setup (recommended baseline)**
      - **Master password:** long passphrase (4-6 random words) or 20+ random characters. Unique.
      - **2FA for Bitwarden:** authenticator app (TOTP) or security key.
      - **Vault timeout:** short on mobile, slightly longer on desktop. Use biometric unlock if available.
      - **Device hygiene:** make sure your phone and desktop have screen locks.

      **Migration workflow that avoids mistakes**
      1) Import only into Bitwarden (do not keep a parallel "notes file" copy once migrated).
      2) Start with high-value accounts: email, bank, primary identity providers (Google/Apple), then work down.
      3) For each account:
         - Update password to a new unique generated password (do not reuse old ones).
         - Add 2FA.
         - Confirm login works.
         - Delete the old record from your notes file.

      **Folder/collection structure that stays usable**
      - Identity: email, banks, government, insurance
      - Work/dev: GitHub, cloud accounts, registrars
      - Shopping: Amazon, etc.
      - Subscriptions: streaming, utilities
      Use tags like: "2FA", "critical", "needs-review".

      **Rule of thumb**
      - If you only do one thing: secure your email and password manager first. Everything else depends on them.

      If you tell me your platforms (Linux/Windows/macOS, iOS/Android) and whether you want browser autofill, I can suggest the exact client + browser extension setup and a sane timeout policy.

      Do I really need to change everything? That GitHub token was just for a small script.
      Also, how do I pick a master password that I can actually remember?
  - assistant: |
      **Yes, revoke the GitHub token.** Tokens are effectively passwords for API access. Even a "small script" token can often read private repos, write code, or access org resources depending on scopes. Revoking is fast and low-cost.

      **Do you need to change everything? A triage approach**
      Change immediately:
      - Password manager master password
      - Primary email account password
      - Bank/financial passwords
      - Any account where the pasted credentials were valid
      - Any account that reused the same password (or a predictable variant)

      Can wait (but should still be rotated):
      - Low-impact accounts that already have strong unique passwords and 2FA
      - Accounts that you are certain were never in that notes file

      **How to choose a master password you can remember**
      Use a passphrase, not a single word with substitutions.
      - Good: 5-6 random words with separators, plus one extra twist you always do.
        Example pattern (do not copy literally): word-word-word-word-word + a short suffix.
      - Avoid: song lyrics, quotes, or anything someone could guess from your interests.

      **Make it memorable without making it weak**
      - Use randomly chosen words, then create a mental image/story connecting them.
      - Keep it typed, not spoken. You only need to remember it, not share it.
      - Practice typing it 10 times, then stop. Repetition helps.

      **2FA is not optional for the master vault**
      Even a great master password is safer with 2FA. If you can, a hardware security key is the most robust option.

      If you want, describe your current setup (browser(s), phone OS, whether you share vault items with anyone) and I will propose a minimal policy: timeouts, 2FA method, and an order to rotate credentials so you finish in one sitting.

      I'm worried I'll lock myself out. What's the best way to store backup codes safely?
  - assistant: |
      The goal is: **offline, redundant, and not in the same place as your unlocked devices**.

      **Good options**
      - Print backup codes and store them in a secure place at home (safe, lockbox).
      - Write them on paper (legible) and store as above.
      - Store them on an encrypted USB drive that is kept offline (plus a spare).

      **Avoid**
      - Saving backup codes in the same notes app you are trying to replace.
      - Emailing them to yourself.
      - Keeping the only copy on your phone (if you lose the phone, you lose access).

      **Practical checklist**
      1) Turn on Bitwarden 2FA.
      2) Download/print backup codes immediately.
      3) Confirm you can use a backup code to log in (test once, then generate a new set if you want).
      4) Store the codes offline.
      5) Only then proceed to rotate high-value accounts.

      If you tell me whether you have access to a printer and whether you can use a security key, I can recommend the simplest setup that minimizes lockout risk.
