      I'm starting a true crime podcast and my research notes are a mess.
      I need a structure for:
      - episode outline
      - sources (articles, court docs, interviews)
      - timeline of events
      - open questions / things to verify
      - a way to keep track of claims so I don't accidentally repeat a rumor

      Can you propose a system that actually scales past a few episodes?
  - assistant: |
      Here is a scalable way to structure research so you can produce episodes without losing provenance.

      1) Use a three-layer structure (Case -> Episode -> Claim)
      - Case (the overall incident): one "case hub" page/folder.
      - Episode (what you publish): one outline per episode, linked back to the case hub.
      - Claims (atomic statements): each claim gets a unique ID and evidence links.

      2) Create a simple schema you can implement in Notion, Obsidian, or plain markdown
      A) Case hub (one page)
      - Summary: 5-10 sentences, written last.
      - People: names, roles, aliases.
      - Locations: with dates.
      - Master timeline: bullet list by date/time.
      - Evidence index: links to the source library.
      - Claim register: a table of claims (see below).

      B) Source library (folder or database)
      For each source:
      - Citation: title, author, outlet, date, URL or file path.
      - Type: news, court record, transcript, FOIA, interview, book, etc.
      - Reliability notes:
        - primary vs secondary
        - first-hand vs hearsay
        - editorial reputation (if relevant)
      - Extracts: short quotes (with page/line markers) and your paraphrase.

      C) Claim register (the part that scales)
      Each claim is one row:
      - Claim ID: CASE-YYYY-### (ex: WESTMEM-1993-017)
      - Claim text: one sentence.
      - Status: confirmed / likely / unclear / disputed / false.
      - Evidence: links to sources, with page/line notes.
      - Dependency: "requires verifying X first" or "contradicted by Y"
      - Used in: episode outline sections where it appears

      3) Add an "episode assembly" template
      Structure each outline as:
      - Cold open (what you can support with strong sourcing)
      - Known facts (claims with status confirmed/likely)
      - Contested zone (claims marked unclear/disputed)
      - Your analysis framing (clearly labeled as interpretation)
      - Outro with what remains unknown + corrections policy

      4) Workflow that prevents rumor bleed
      - You never write the narrative from memory.
      - You write it by pulling Claim IDs into the outline.
      - If a sentence does not have a Claim ID, it does not go into the script.

      If you tell me what tool you prefer (Notion vs Obsidian vs Google Docs), I can format this as a ready-to-copy template.

      This is good. I'm worried about defamation, though.
      How do I talk about suspects or allegations without getting reckless?
  - assistant: |
      I am not a lawyer, but I can give practical risk-reduction patterns that creators commonly use.

      1) Separate "what happened" from "what is alleged"
      - Use explicit language gates:
        - "According to the charging document..."
        - "Police alleged..."
        - "In sworn testimony..."
        - "The defense argued..."
      - Avoid blending allegations into declarative narration.

      2) Prefer primary documents and attribute them precisely
      - If the claim comes from a court filing, say that.
      - If it comes from a single news story, say that and seek corroboration.
      - For interviews, distinguish: first-hand witness vs repeating someone else.

      3) Keep your own statements narrowly factual
      - Avoid character judgments ("he is a monster") and stick to verifiable events.
      - If you do analysis, label it as analysis and base it on cited facts.

      4) Handle disputed claims as disputed, not as mystery flavor
      - Create a "disputed" section where you present both sides with citations.
      - If something is only rumor-level, treat it as "unverified" and consider excluding it.

      5) Corrections policy and documentation
      - Publish a corrections email and maintain a corrections log.
      - Keep your internal claim register so you can show your sourcing trail if challenged.

      6) When to consult counsel
      - Living private individuals
      - Uncharged suspects
      - Claims about sexual conduct, fraud, or anything that could harm reputation
      - When your sources are thin or contradictory

      If you want, describe one example sentence you plan to say, and I can suggest safer phrasing patterns without changing the substance.

      What's a good "fact-check" routine right before I record?
  - assistant: |
      A tight pre-record checklist that catches the common failures:

      A) Script pass (15-30 minutes)
      - Highlight every factual sentence.
      - Every highlighted sentence must map to:
        - a Claim ID, and
        - at least one linked source (ideally two for major points).
      - Any sentence without sourcing gets rewritten or cut.

      B) Names/dates/places pass (10 minutes)
      - Check spelling consistency for names and agencies.
      - Verify dates against the master timeline.
      - Confirm geography (city/county/state) is correct.

      C) Allegation labeling pass (10 minutes)
      - Circle any sentence about "who did it" or "motive".
      - Ensure attribution language is present.
      - Ensure you do not imply certainty where the record is uncertain.

      D) Audio/legal hygiene pass (5 minutes)
      - Remove jokes that could be read as character judgments.
      - Remove anything you cannot defend with your own citations.
      - Confirm you are not accidentally sharing private contact info from documents.

      E) Post-record plan
      - Put all sources cited in show notes.
      - Keep your claim register updated with "used in episode X" so you can issue corrections fast.

      This routine is short enough to run every time, and it scales because it depends on the claim register rather than your memory.
