      I'm doing my first drag performance and I need heels that won't ruin my feet.
      I usually wear a US men's 11 in sneakers. How do I convert that to heels (women's sizes),
      and how do I pick something that will actually stay on during a set?

      Here is the practical way to approach it.

      **1) Convert your starting size (then verify by measurement)**
      - A common rule of thumb: US women's size is about US men's size + 1.5.
      - If you are a US men's 11, your starting point is often around a US women's 12.5.
      - Brands vary a lot, so treat that as a first guess, not a guarantee.

      **Better than guessing:** measure your foot.
      - Length: heel to longest toe (in inches or cm).
      - Width: widest part of the forefoot.
      Then compare to the brand's size chart (many stage-heel brands provide one).

      **2) Choose the right construction for stage stability**
      - Look for an ankle strap, T-strap, or lace-up. Slip-ons are the hardest to keep secure.
      - A chunkier heel or a platform can feel more stable than a thin stiletto at the same height.
      - Prefer a slightly lower heel height for the first shows (you can go higher later).

      **3) Fit rules that prevent pain and injuries**
      - Toes should not be crammed or hanging over the front.
      - Heel should not lift significantly when you walk.
      - If you are between sizes, many performers size up and use inserts or pads to fine-tune.
      - If you have a wider forefoot, prioritize brands that offer wide widths, or styles with a roomier toe box.

      **4) Keep them on your feet**
      - Use gel ball-of-foot pads to reduce sliding forward.
      - Add a thin heel grip if you get heel slip.
      - Consider "shoe straps" or additional elastic support for intense choreography.
      - Break them in at home: short sessions, then longer, then full run-throughs.

      **Quick shopping checklist**
      - Strap style: ankle strap or lace-up
      - Heel height: start lower than you think
      - Return policy: essential
      - Enough room for inserts/padding
      - Try on late day (feet swell)

      If you tell me whether your feet run wide or narrow, and whether you want a closed toe vs open toe, I can narrow down what styles are most forgiving.

      My feet are a bit wide. Also I'm ordering from a UK site. If I'm roughly women's 12.5,
      what does that translate to in UK sizes? And should I size up for wide feet?
  - assistant: |
      **UK conversion (rough, verify by chart)**
      - US women's 12.5 is often around UK women's 10.5 to 11.
      - Some brands do not offer half sizes in UK sizing, so you may be choosing between 10 and 11.

      **For wider feet**
      - First choice: buy the wide width if offered (often labeled "W", "Wide", or "E/EE" depending on brand).
      - If wide width is not offered: sizing up by 0.5 can help for closed-toe heels, but it can also increase heel slip.
      - The safer pattern is: keep length correct, then use a wider-friendly style (open toe, softer upper, adjustable straps) plus inserts.

      **How to avoid the common trap (longer shoe, still tight)**
      - If the upper material is stiff and narrow, going longer does not always fix forefoot squeeze.
      - Look for styles with:
        - Adjustable straps (multiple holes, buckle)
        - Stretch panels or softer uppers
        - A rounder toe shape (almond/round beats pointy)

      **Buying strategy if returns are possible**
      - Order two nearby sizes (for example UK 10 and UK 11) and return one.
      - Add inexpensive gel pads and heel grips at the same time so you can test the real stage setup.

      If you can share one specific brand/model link and whether it is closed-toe, I can tell you whether "size up" is likely to help or likely to cause heel slip for that exact style.

      Last thing: is there a simple way to break them in without getting blisters?
  - assistant: |
      Yes. The goal is to condition your feet and the shoe together while preventing hot spots.

      **Break-in plan (3 to 7 days)**
      1) 10-15 minutes at home with socks (if the style allows) to soften contact points.
      2) Switch to bare feet or tights for 10-15 minutes and note any rubbing areas.
      3) Add pads/heel grips only where needed (do not over-pad everywhere).
      4) Increase time gradually until you can do a full set walk-through.

      **Blister prevention**
      - Identify hot spots early and cover them with blister bandages before they blister.
      - Use a small amount of anti-chafe balm on friction points.
      - Keep feet dry (foot powder can help if you sweat).
      - If the shoe rubs in one spot, a tiny piece of moleskin inside the shoe can make a big difference.

      **Reality check**
      - If a shoe causes sharp pain immediately, it is usually the wrong fit or shape for your foot. Break-in helps minor friction, not structural mismatch.
