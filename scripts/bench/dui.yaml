      I got pulled over last Saturday night and I'm pretty sure I was
      over the legal limit. The officer asked me to do a field sobriety
      test and I refused. Then they took me to the station for a
      breathalyzer and I blew a 0.11. This is my first offense. What
      should I expect?

      I'm sorry to hear about your situation. I can give you some general
      information, but please consult a lawyer for advice specific to
      your case.

      For a first-offense DUI with a 0.11 BAC:

      **Immediate consequences:**
      - Your license is likely suspended. Most states have an
        administrative suspension that kicks in within days of the
        arrest, separate from any court proceedings.
      - You may have been given a temporary driving permit at the
        station.

      **What to expect in court:**
      - First offense DUI is typically a misdemeanor.
      - Penalties vary by state but often include: fines ($500-$2000),
        probation (6-12 months), mandatory alcohol education classes,
        possible community service.
      - Jail time for a first offense at 0.11 is unlikely but not
        impossible depending on your jurisdiction.

      **Refusal of field sobriety test:**
      - Refusing the field test (walking a line, etc.) is generally
        within your rights and can't be used against you in most states.
      - The breathalyzer at the station is different -- refusing that
        often carries its own penalties under implied consent laws.

      **My strong recommendation:** Get a DUI attorney. Many offer free
      consultations. The difference between having representation and
      going it alone can be significant, especially regarding license
      suspension and plea options.

      Can this show up on background checks? I'm applying for jobs right
      now and I'm worried.
  - assistant: |
      Yes, a DUI conviction will show up on criminal background checks.
      Here's what you need to know:

      - **Before conviction:** The arrest itself may show up on some
        checks, but many employers only look at convictions.
      - **After conviction:** It will appear on criminal background
        checks. How long depends on your state -- some allow expungement
        after a waiting period (often 5-10 years for a first offense).
      - **Driving record:** It will show on your MVR (motor vehicle
        record) for longer, sometimes permanently.
      - **Professional licenses:** If you're in a field that requires
        licensure (healthcare, law, education, finance), you may need
        to self-report.

      For job applications, the timing matters. If you haven't been
      convicted yet (the court process can take months), you can
      truthfully answer "no" to "have you been convicted of a crime"
      on most applications. But never lie -- that's worse than the DUI
      itself.
