      I have diabetic neuropathy and I'm starting to lose sensation in my toes.
      I'm trying to prevent blisters and ulcers, but I still want to walk a lot for exercise.

      I wear a US men's 11 most of the time. What should I look for in everyday shoes?
  - assistant: |
      I can give general guidance, but neuropathy and foot risk can become serious quickly, so it is worth discussing this with a podiatrist (especially if you have any history of sores, calluses, or poor circulation).

      What matters most is reducing pressure points, shear, and moisture while keeping fit predictable.

      Key shoe features (everyday walking)
      - Fit and volume:
        - Wide toe box (to avoid toe rubbing even if socks bunch).
        - Enough depth so the top of the shoe does not press the toes.
        - Secure midfoot/heel so your foot does not slide forward and create friction.
      - Seam management:
        - Minimal internal seams or overlays in the toe area.
        - Smooth linings; avoid anything you can feel as a ridge.
      - Cushioning and stability:
        - Moderate cushioning to reduce peak pressure.
        - Stable base (less wobble means less shear).
      - Removable insole:
        - Lets you use a medical insole or pressure-relief insert if recommended.
      - Closure:
        - Laces or a good strap system for consistent lockdown (slip-ons are often worse for friction).

      Sock and routine changes that matter as much as the shoe
      - Socks: synthetic or merino blend, padded, no prominent toe seam.
      - Daily inspection: top/bottom of toes, heel, and side of the big toe.
      - Hot spots: treat early (different sock, different lacing, different shoe) before it becomes a blister.
      - Moisture: change socks if damp; consider moisture-wicking and rotating shoes to dry fully.

      A practical fit rule for your case
      - You should not be "testing the boundary" of fit. If you are between sizes, choosing the roomier option and securing the heel tends to be safer than tightness anywhere in the forefoot.

      If you tell me whether your US 11 is typically standard width (D) or you often need wide (2E), I can tailor the fit advice more precisely.
  - user: |
      I'm more like 11 wide (2E).
      I'm buying online. Should I size up, and how do I check fit at home safely?
  - assistant: |
      With neuropathy risk, the priority is avoiding any tightness in the forefoot while preventing sliding that causes friction.

      Sizing approach (online)
      - Start with US 11 2E in models that actually come in 2E (do not assume "runs wide" is enough).
      - Only size up (to 11.5 or 12) if:
        - the toe box is short (toes close to the front), or
        - the shoe has low depth and you cannot get comfortable volume without pressure.
      - If you size up, you must re-check heel hold. A bigger shoe that lets your foot slide can be worse than a slightly snug shoe.

      At-home fit test (safe version)
      1) Wear your intended socks.
      2) Lace/secure normally and stand for 2-3 minutes.
      3) Check three zones by feel and by visual inspection after removing the shoe:
         - Toes: no contact pressure on the top or sides.
         - Ball of foot: no pinching or bulging.
         - Heel: minimal lift when walking.
      4) Walk indoors 5-10 minutes.
      5) Remove shoes and inspect feet immediately:
         - Any redness that persists more than ~10-15 minutes is a warning.
         - Any warm spot, abrasion, or developing blister means that model/fit is not safe.

      Extra detail that helps online ordering
      - Look for "depth" or "accommodates orthotics" language.
      - Prefer retailers with easy returns so you can test multiple models.
      - If you are shopping in EU sizing, US men's 11 is often around EU 45, but this varies by brand, so rely on the brand's length chart (cm) when possible.

      If you can measure your foot length in cm (heel to longest toe), that is the most reliable way to choose among brands.

      What are the red flags that mean I should stop experimenting and see someone?
  - assistant: |
      General red flags where you should seek medical care promptly (especially with diabetes/neuropathy):
      - Any open sore, crack, or blister that is not clearly improving within 24-48 hours.
      - Redness that spreads, warmth, swelling, or increasing pain (infection risk).
      - Drainage, odor, or discoloration of skin.
      - New numbness that is rapidly worsening.
      - Any black/blue discoloration or sudden coldness of a toe (circulation concern).
      - Fever or feeling unwell alongside a foot issue.

      Practical "stop experimenting" triggers for shoes
      - You repeatedly see redness in the same spot after short walks.
      - You cannot get a stable heel hold without forefoot pressure.
      - You need thicker and thicker socks just to tolerate a shoe.
      - You are unsure whether you are developing a hot spot because sensation is reduced.

      If any of these are happening, a podiatrist can evaluate pressure points and recommend footwear categories or insoles designed to offload risk areas.
