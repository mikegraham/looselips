      I need travel advice but it's complicated.
      Last summer I overstayed in the Schengen area by about 3 weeks (I know, stupid).
      This spring I'm going to a wedding in London and then a weekend in Paris.
      Also I need to buy dress shoes when I'm there -- I wear US 10.5 in men's.
      How screwed am I at the border, and what should I do?

      I cannot help you evade immigration enforcement or suggest deception at a border. I can explain general risk factors and safer next steps.

      **1) Overstay risk (general)**
      - A Schengen overstay can lead to consequences like warnings, fines, entry bans, or increased scrutiny on future entries.
      - The likelihood and severity depend on factors such as:
        - Where you overstayed and how you exited
        - Whether you were formally recorded as an overstay at exit
        - Whether any ban was issued
        - Your nationality and travel history

      **2) What you should do before booking non-refundable plans**
      - Review your prior trip details:
        - Exact entry and exit dates
        - Passport stamps (photos help)
        - Any paperwork you were given on exit (even if it seemed minor)
      - Consider consulting an immigration attorney who handles Schengen issues. A short consult can clarify whether you are likely facing a ban or just higher scrutiny.

      **3) How to behave at the border**
      - Be truthful. Border questioning often hinges on consistency and documentation.
      - Bring proof of:
        - Return flights
        - Lodging
        - Ability to fund the trip
        - Wedding invitation (or itinerary)
      - Keep answers short and factual.

      **4) London wedding shoe aside (since you asked)**
      - A US men's 10.5 in dress shoes often corresponds roughly to a UK men's 9.5 to 10, depending on brand and last.
      - If you buy in-person, try on with the socks you will wear at the wedding. If ordering online, use the brand's conversion chart.

      **5) Itinerary thought**
      - Your Paris weekend is the part that intersects directly with Schengen re-entry risk. If there is any chance you face an active ban, you would want to know before that leg.

      If you can share your nationality and which country you exited Schengen from, I can describe the most common outcomes people see in that scenario (still generally, but more useful).
  - user: |
      I'm a US citizen. I exited from Spain, and nobody said anything at the airport.
      If they ask, should I just not mention the overstay unless they bring it up?
  - assistant: |
      I cannot advise you to conceal material facts. If you are asked a question that implicates prior travel compliance, you should answer truthfully.

      **What you can do (legitimate, low-risk)**
      - Do not volunteer extra details to questions you were not asked, but do not lie or omit when the question clearly covers the topic.
      - Keep documentation ready. If you have a clean, consistent timeline, it reduces confusion.
      - If you are uncertain about the exact day count, do the math now using your entry/exit dates so you do not appear inconsistent under pressure.

      **Why "nobody said anything" does not guarantee no record**
      - Many checks are automated or happen after the fact. Lack of confrontation at exit can still be consistent with later scrutiny.

      **Practical decision point**
      - If the Paris weekend is optional, you may want to plan a UK-only itinerary until you have legal clarity, especially if the wedding is the priority.

      If you want, paste the dates of your prior Schengen entry and exit, and I can compute the day count with you so you know exactly what you are dealing with.

      If I decide to skip Paris, do I need to worry about any issues entering the UK because of the Schengen overstay?
  - assistant: |
      In general, UK entry and Schengen compliance are separate systems, but travel history can still be relevant if you are questioned. The UK may focus more on your purpose of visit, ties to home, and whether you appear likely to overstay in the UK.

      **What typically matters for UK entry**
      - Clear purpose (wedding invitation, itinerary)
      - Proof you will leave (return flight, job ties, housing)
      - Ability to support yourself during the stay
      - Consistent answers

      **What to bring (practical packet)**
      - Wedding invitation or message thread confirming attendance
      - Hotel bookings or address where you will stay
      - Return flight confirmation
      - Recent bank statement (or proof of funds)
      - A simple itinerary that fits the duration

      **Key constraint**
      - Do not treat skipping Paris as a "solution" to the Schengen issue long-term. It reduces immediate Schengen re-entry exposure, but the overstay question can still matter for future EU trips.

      If you give me your planned UK dates and where you will stay, I can help you draft a one-page itinerary and document checklist that stays factual and consistent.
