      My partner and I just found out we're pregnant (8 weeks) and we're trying to
      figure out when and how to tell our families. This is our first, and both sets
      of parents are going to be over the moon -- they've been not-so-subtly hinting
      about grandkids for years. Any advice on timing or creative announcement ideas?
  - assistant: |
      Congratulations! This is such an exciting time. The timing question is very
      personal, but here are some things to consider:

      Many people wait until after the first trimester (12-13 weeks) to announce more
      broadly, since the risk of miscarriage drops significantly after that point.
      However, immediate family is often told earlier -- whenever you feel comfortable
      and want their support.

      Since you're at 8 weeks now, you might consider:

      - Telling parents now or soon, especially if you'll want their support if
      anything goes wrong. Many couples find it helpful to have close family know
      early.

      - Waiting until after a first ultrasound (usually around 8-10 weeks) so you have
      a picture to share and have confirmed viability.

      - Waiting until 12 weeks if you prefer to keep it private until you're through
      the highest-risk period.

      As for announcement ideas for parents, since they're excited for this:

      - Ultrasound picture in a frame with "Coming Soon [Due Date]"
      - A children's book wrapped as a gift with a note like "For grandma/grandpa to
      read to their grandchild"
      - A onesie that says "I love my grandma/grandpa"
      - A simple "you're going to be grandparents!" at a family dinner

      The best announcements are the ones that feel authentic to you. Since your
      parents are eager, honestly any way you tell them will be met with joy!

      I love the ultrasound picture idea -- we have our first appointment next week
      so that timing would work perfectly. I'm a little nervous about the work
      situation though. I haven't told my employer yet and I'm worried about how
      it might affect things. I was supposed to be considered for a promotion to
      senior manager in the next few months, and I'm scared they'll pass me over if
      they know I'll be going on maternity leave next year.

      Your concerns are completely understandable, and unfortunately, they're concerns
      many pregnant people face in the workplace. Let me address both the legal and
      practical aspects:

      Legally, pregnancy discrimination is prohibited under federal law (Pregnancy
      Discrimination Act) and many state laws. Employers cannot legally deny you a
      promotion because you're pregnant. However, proving discrimination is difficult,
      and implicit bias absolutely exists.

      From a practical standpoint, here's what you might consider:

      Timing of disclosure: You're not legally required to tell your employer until
      you need accommodations or want to arrange leave. Many people wait until the
      second trimester (after 12-14 weeks) when pregnancy becomes more visible and
      the risk of complications is lower.

      Promotion timeline: If the promotion decision is happening in the next 2-3
      months and you're only 8 weeks now, you could potentially wait to disclose until
      after the decision is made. You'd likely be in your second trimester by then
      anyway. This isn't dishonest -- it's your private medical information.

      However, if you'd be obviously showing before the decision, or if the pregnancy
      requires any accommodations that make it necessary to disclose, that changes
      the calculation.

      When you do tell them: Frame it professionally and proactively. Have a plan for
      your leave, transition of responsibilities, and return. Show that you're thinking
      about business continuity. This can help address concerns before they're raised.
  - user: |
      Yeah, the promotion review is probably 3-4 months out based on what my manager
      said, so I'd be around 18-20 weeks by then. I'd definitely be showing. I just
      hate feeling like I have to choose between being honest and getting the
      recognition I've earned. I've been working toward this for two years.
  - assistant: |
      That frustration is completely valid. You shouldn't have to choose, and the fact
      that you're even worried about it points to real systemic problems in how
      workplaces treat pregnancy and parenthood.

      Here's my perspective: You haven't done anything wrong by getting pregnant, and
      you've earned your promotion based on two years of work. Your ability to do the
      senior manager job isn't diminished by planning to take parental leave.

      Some thoughts on navigating this:

      Document your achievements: Start keeping a detailed record of your
      accomplishments, projects delivered, and impact. If you're passed over for
      promotion, having documentation makes it easier to advocate for yourself or,
      if necessary, demonstrate a pattern of discrimination.

      Consider your workplace culture: Do you have examples of how your company has
      treated other pregnant employees or new parents? Have people been promoted while
      pregnant or shortly after returning from leave? This can give you a sense of
      what to expect.

      Know your worth: If your company does pass you over explicitly or implicitly
      because of your pregnancy, that tells you something important about whether this
      is a place that will support your long-term career as a parent. That's valuable
      information, even if it's disappointing.

      Advocacy: When you do disclose, you might say something like: "I'm excited to
      share that I'm expecting a baby in [month]. I'm also excited about the senior
      manager opportunity we discussed. I'm committed to this role and this team, and
      I'm planning for a smooth transition during my leave." This frames both as
      positive and compatible.

      I wish I could tell you there's a perfect strategy that eliminates all risk. The
      reality is that pregnancy bias exists, even when it's illegal. But you deserve
      both the promotion you've earned and the family you're building.
  - user: |
      Thank you, that's really validating to hear. I think I'll wait until after the
      first trimester to tell work, and I'll definitely start documenting everything
      in the meantime. For now, I'm going to focus on the exciting part -- telling
      our families -- and try not to stress too much about work yet.
  - assistant: |
      That sounds like a healthy approach. You're going through a major life
      transition, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Focus on your
      health, your growing family, and the people who will be unambiguously thrilled
      for you right now.

      The work situation will unfold as it unfolds, and you'll handle it when you
      need to. In the meantime, documentation is smart, and keeping your options open
      is wise. But you don't need to solve everything today.

      A few practical tips as you move forward:

      - Start learning about your company's parental leave policy now, even if you
      don't announce yet. Understanding what you're entitled to helps you plan.

      - Look into FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) requirements if you're in the
      US -- it provides job protection for eligible employees, though it's unpaid
      unless your employer offers paid leave.

      - Consider connecting with other parents at your company, if possible. They can
      be great sources of information and support about how things actually work in
      your specific workplace culture.

      But yes -- for this week, enjoy planning how to tell your parents. That's the
      fun part, and they're going to be absolutely thrilled. That ultrasound picture
      announcement is going to make their whole year.

      Congratulations again, and good luck with your appointment next week!
