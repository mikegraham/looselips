      I've been bouldering at my local gym for about 3 months and I'm ready to invest in my own climbing shoes. I've been renting so far but I want something that will help me progress. Any recommendations?
  - assistant: |
      Great timing -- three months in is perfect for buying your first pair of climbing shoes. At this stage, you want something comfortable enough to wear for full sessions but more performance-oriented than rentals.

      For beginner-to-intermediate climbers, I'd recommend:

      All-Around Shoes:
      - La Sportiva Tarantulace -- affordable, comfortable, durable, great fit for wider feet
      - Scarpa Origin -- similar comfort and versatility, runs slightly narrow
      - Five Ten Rogue VCS -- Velcro closure (easy on/off), sticky rubber, good for gym climbing

      Slightly More Aggressive (if you're progressing quickly):
      - La Sportiva Finale -- comfortable but with a bit of downturn for overhangs
      - Evolv Defy -- versatile, not too aggressive, good for gym and outdoor

      Key factors when shopping:
      - Climbing shoes should fit snugly but not painfully (you're not at the "performance pain" level yet)
      - Your toes should be slightly curled but not crunched
      - No dead space or air pockets around the heel
      - Try them on late in the day when feet are slightly swollen
      - Expect leather to stretch about half a size; synthetics stay more true to size

      What's your street shoe size, and do you have wider or narrower feet? That'll help narrow down which brands to focus on.
  - user: |
      I wear EUR 42 normally, which I think is US size 9. I have pretty average width feet, maybe slightly narrow. I've heard you should size down for climbing shoes -- is that true?
  - assistant: |
      Yes, EUR 42 is typically US 9 for men's (or US 10.5-11 for women's, if applicable). And you're right that climbing shoes generally fit smaller than street shoes, but the amount varies significantly based on the shoe style and your goals.

      Sizing guidelines for your first pair:

      For comfortable all-day shoes (what I'd recommend now):
      - Size down 0.5 to 1 EUR size from your street shoe
      - So you'd likely be looking at EUR 41 or 41.5
      - They should feel snug like a firm handshake, not painful
      - You should be able to wear them for 30-45 minute sessions comfortably

      For more aggressive shoes (later in your progression):
      - Size down 1.5 to 2+ EUR sizes
      - These are meant to be uncomfortable; you take them off between attempts
      - Not recommended until you're climbing V4-V5 or 5.11+ regularly

      At EUR 42 street size with average-to-narrow feet, good options:
      - La Sportiva Tarantulace in 41 or 41.5 (La Sportiva runs narrow, which suits you)
      - Scarpa Origin in 41 (Scarpa also runs narrow)
      - Five Ten Rogue in 41.5 (Five Ten runs slightly wider, so size down less)

      The "average width" foot is actually pretty rare -- most people lean one way or the other. La Sportiva and Scarpa are known for narrower European fits, while Five Ten and Evolv tend toward wider American fits.

      Shopping tips:
      - Buy from a store with a good return policy; online sizing is tough
      - Wear them around the store for 10+ minutes
      - Try to stand on a small foothold (many climbing shops have a little test wall)
      - Your toes should touch the front with a slight curl, heel should be locked in with no lift

      Have you been working on any specific weaknesses in your climbing, like overhangs or slabs? That might influence which shoe style would help most.
  - user: |
      Overhangs are definitely my weakness. I feel like my feet keep slipping off holds when I'm trying to do steep problems. Is that a shoe thing or a technique thing?
  - assistant: |
      It's almost certainly technique, not the shoes. Rental shoes are absolutely capable of handling gym overhangs at the V0-V3 level, which is probably where you're climbing after three months.

      Common footwork mistakes on overhangs:

      1. Not engaging the posterior chain: Your toes should be actively pulling on holds, not just resting. Think about curling your toes like you're trying to grip the hold.

      2. Poor weight distribution: On steep terrain, you want maximum weight on your feet. This means:
         - Keeping hips close to the wall (don't let them sag away)
         - Pushing through your big toe, not the ball of your foot
         - Driving your knees outward to engage your legs

      3. Lazy foot placement: Every foot placement should be deliberate and precise. Watch better climbers -- they place their foot once and it sticks. Beginners often slap their foot on and readjust.

      4. Not using your heels: Heel hooks are your secret weapon on overhangs. They let you use your hamstrings and glutes (big muscles) instead of just your arms.

      Drills to improve overhang footwork:
      - "Quiet feet" drill: Climb a problem focusing on placing each foot silently. This forces precision.
      - Hover hands: On easier terrain, hover your hands above holds without gripping. This forces you to weight your feet.
      - Straight arm climbing: Keep your arms straight as much as possible; this makes you use your feet more.

      That said, better shoes will help marginally. The stickier rubber and snugger fit of new shoes give you maybe 5-10% better grip. But improving your technique will give you 100%+ improvement.

      When you get your new shoes, spend the first few sessions re-climbing easy problems (V0-V1) to get used to how they feel. The better feedback from a proper fit will help you learn what good foot placement feels like.

      Are you climbing alone or with people who can give you feedback on your technique?
  - user: |
      Usually alone, which is maybe part of the problem. I don't really know if I'm doing things right. Are there good resources for learning technique or should I just take a class?
  - assistant: |
      Climbing alone makes improvement harder -- you can't see what you're doing, and it's easy to reinforce bad habits. I'd strongly recommend a combination approach:

      1. Take a technique class or hire a coach (if budget allows):
      Most gyms offer intermediate technique classes covering footwork, body positioning, and movement efficiency. Even 2-3 sessions with a coach can be transformative because they'll catch specific issues in your movement patterns.

      2. Find climbing partners or join a gym group:
      Most gyms have meetup nights or social climbing groups. Benefits:
      - Watch how others solve problems
      - Get beta (advice) on sequences
      - Have someone video your attempts (huge for self-analysis)
      - Stay motivated and make friends

      3. Video yourself:
      Set up your phone and record yourself climbing. Watch it back and compare to videos of better climbers doing the same problems. You'll immediately see things like:
      - "Oh, my hips are way too far from the wall"
      - "I'm using a lot more hand moves than they are"
      - "My feet are sliding around constantly"

      4. Online resources (use these in addition to, not instead of, real feedback):
      - YouTube channels: "Lattice Training," "Catalyst Climbing," "Hooper's Beta," "Movement for Climbers"
      - Focus on footwork and body positioning videos (these are most beneficial for beginners)
      - Neil Gresham's Masterclass is excellent and systematic

      5. Active observation at the gym:
      Don't just climb and leave. Spend 10-15 minutes watching strong climbers, especially on problems you're working. Notice:
      - How precisely they place their feet
      - How they position their hips
      - How long they rest and chalk up
      - Which holds they use vs. which they skip

      The biggest mistake I see beginner climbers make is spending 100% of their gym time climbing and 0% learning. You'll progress much faster if you divide your time into 70% climbing, 20% watching/analyzing, and 10% drilling specific techniques.

      Starting a conversation with other climbers is easy -- just ask for beta on a problem you're working. Climbers are generally super friendly and love to share advice (sometimes too much).
