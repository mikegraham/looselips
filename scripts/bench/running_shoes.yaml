      I'm looking for new running shoes. I'm a size 10.5 wide (2E) and
      I overpronate. Budget is around $130. Any suggestions?

      For a size 10.5 2E with overpronation, here are some solid options
      in your budget:

      1. Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24 (~$130) -- One of the most popular
         stability shoes. Runs true to size and comes in wide. The
         GuideRails support system helps with overpronation without
         feeling rigid.

      2. ASICS Gel-Kayano 31 (~$130-140) -- A classic stability shoe.
         The wide version fits generous in the forefoot. The gel
         cushioning is great for longer runs.

      3. New Balance 860v14 (~$120) -- NB is known for excellent wide
         sizing. The medial post provides good pronation control.

      I'd suggest trying them on late in the day when your feet are
      slightly swollen, since that's closer to how they'll feel on a run.

      I've tried Brooks before and liked them. My only issue is that my
      right foot is slightly bigger -- like a half size difference. Do you
      think I should size up to 11?

      A half-size asymmetry is really common. Here's what I'd recommend:

      - Size up to 11 in the 2E width. A little extra room in the
        smaller foot is much better than cramping the larger one.
      - You can use a slightly thicker insole or lace the smaller shoe
        tighter to compensate.
      - Some specialty running stores will actually let you buy
        mismatched sizes, though it's rare. Worth asking.

      The Brooks Adrenaline has a pretty forgiving toe box, so going up
      to 11 in wide shouldn't feel sloppy on the smaller foot.
