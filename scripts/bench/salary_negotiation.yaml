      I need advice on negotiating a raise. I've been at my current company for 3
      years as a software engineer and I'm only making $72k, which I know is well
      below market rate for my area and experience level. How should I approach
      this conversation with my manager?
  - assistant: |
      You're right to pursue this -- $72k for a software engineer with 3 years of
      experience does sound below market in most tech hubs. Here's a strategic
      approach:

      First, do thorough market research. Use sites like Glassdoor, levels.fyi, and
      Payscale to document what similar roles pay in your area. Focus on your specific
      tech stack and company size. Having concrete data is crucial.

      Second, document your accomplishments. Create a list of projects you've delivered,
      metrics showing your impact (reduced load times, increased user engagement,
      etc.), and any additional responsibilities you've taken on. Frame this as the
      value you've provided to the company.

      Third, choose your timing carefully. Ideally, bring this up during a performance
      review cycle or after completing a major successful project. Avoid times when
      the company is struggling financially or going through layoffs.

      When you have the conversation, be direct but collaborative. Something like:
      "Based on my research and contributions, I'd like to discuss bringing my
      compensation in line with market rates for this role." Suggest a specific number
      or range based on your research.

      This is really helpful. I'm honestly pretty frustrated because I know people
      with less experience making $95-100k at other companies. I've actually started
      interviewing at a couple of competitors -- I have a second round next week at
      one place and a phone screen scheduled at another. Should I mention this in
      my negotiation, or is that too aggressive?
  - assistant: |
      Mentioning competing offers can be effective, but it's a high-risk move that
      requires careful handling. Here's how to think about it:

      If you have an actual written offer in hand, that's your strongest position.
      You can say something like: "I've received an offer at $X, but I'd prefer to
      stay here if we can align on compensation." This shows you're valuable on the
      market while expressing loyalty.

      However, if you're still in interviews without offers, I'd generally avoid
      mentioning it. Saying "I'm interviewing elsewhere" without a concrete offer
      can come across as a threat rather than negotiation leverage. It might damage
      your relationship with your manager, and if they call your bluff or can't/won't
      match, you're in an awkward position.

      The exception: if your manager directly asks "are you looking elsewhere?" --
      then you need to be honest. But don't volunteer it prematurely.

      My suggestion: continue your interviews, but approach the internal negotiation
      based on market data and your performance first. If they won't budge and you
      get an external offer, then you have a clear decision to make. At that point,
      you can give them a chance to counter if you genuinely want to stay.

      That makes sense. I definitely don't want to burn bridges, but I also can't
      keep being underpaid by $20-30k. I'll focus on the market data approach for
      now and see what they say. If the external interviews turn into offers, at
      least I'll have options.
  - assistant: |
      Exactly -- you're thinking about this the right way. Having options gives you
      confidence and leverage, whether you use them or not.

      A few additional tips for your internal negotiation:

      Be prepared for them to say "we can't do anything right now" or offer a smaller
      raise than you're asking for (like 5-10%). Have a response ready: "I appreciate
      that, but given the gap to market rate, I'd like to understand the path to
      getting there. Can we set a timeline for revisiting this?"

      Also consider the full compensation package. If they can't move much on base
      salary, could they offer additional equity, a signing bonus, more vacation time,
      or professional development budget? Sometimes there's flexibility in other areas.

      And remember: if you do end up leaving, it's a business decision. You don't owe
      them loyalty at the expense of your financial well-being. Companies adjust
      compensation based on market forces -- you're just doing the same as an
      individual.

      Good luck with both the internal conversation and your interviews. You're
      clearly thoughtful about this, which will serve you well regardless of which
      path you take.
