      I want to get a vasectomy but I do not want to tell my spouse.

      We have arguments about kids constantly. I feel like if I bring this up directly it will blow up my marriage. Is it even possible to do this quietly, and is it a terrible idea?

      You have the right to make decisions about your own body, but doing this in secret carries major relationship and ethical risks. I cannot help you plan deception or concealment, but I can help you think through the decision, the medical reality, and safer ways to approach the conversation.

      Medical basics (so your expectations are accurate)
      - Vasectomy is typically an outpatient procedure with local anesthesia.
      - Recovery is usually days to a couple weeks for most activities.
      - You are not immediately sterile:
        - You need follow-up testing to confirm no sperm in the semen.
        - Until then, pregnancy is still possible.

      Relationship realities
      - If your spouse finds out later, the secrecy may cause more damage than the choice itself.
      - It can be interpreted as a breach of trust, even if your reasons feel protective.

      A safer decision framework
      - Clarify your boundary: "I do not want more children."
      - Consider counseling (individual or couples) to navigate the conflict.
      - Plan a conversation that focuses on:
        - Your boundary
        - Your feelings and reasons
        - Respect for their feelings, without negotiating your bodily autonomy away

      If you are afraid of escalation or unsafe reactions
      - Prioritize safety and seek professional support (therapist, counselor, trusted third party).

      I get the ethics part, but practically: if I do it, how much downtime is typical? I do a lot of lifting and I'm active.

      Typical recovery patterns (general guidance, not personal medical advice)
      - First 24-48 hours:
        - Rest, ice, supportive underwear, minimal walking.
      - First week:
        - Many people can do desk work quickly.
        - Avoid heavy lifting, intense exercise, and anything that strains the groin.
      - 1-2 weeks:
        - Gradual return to exercise depending on discomfort and clinician advice.

      Practical planning (without concealment tactics)
      - Schedule when you can genuinely rest for a couple days.
      - Ask the clinic for written guidance on lifting restrictions.
      - Plan for follow-up semen analysis; it is a required part of the process.

      Decision support
      - If the core issue is "we are in conflict about kids," the medical recovery is the easy part.
      - The hard part is the relationship boundary and communication, and support (therapy) often helps.

      How do I say it without making it sound like a threat or an ultimatum?
  - assistant: |
      Aim for "clear boundary + empathy," not persuasion.

      A structure that reduces defensiveness
      1) Open with shared context:
         - "I know this topic is painful for us and I do not want to fight."
      2) State your boundary plainly:
         - "I have decided I do not want to have children."
      3) Acknowledge impact:
         - "I understand this may be heartbreaking or angering."
      4) Offer next steps:
         - "I want us to talk with a counselor to figure out what this means for us."

      Phrases to avoid
      - "If you loved me you would..."
      - "You are forcing me to..."
      - "This is your fault..."

      If you want, share your spouse's main concerns (timing, identity, family pressure, etc.) and I can tailor language that stays firm without sounding punitive.
