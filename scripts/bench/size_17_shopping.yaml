      I need to buy dress shoes for a wedding next month. I wear a size 17
      and I'm having a really hard time finding anything that doesn't look
      like a clown shoe. Any suggestions?

      Size 17 is definitely a challenge for dress shoes, but there are some
      solid options out there. The good news is that a few brands specialize
      in extended sizes and actually make attractive shoes.

      Here are your best bets:

      1. **Nordstrom** -- Their extended size selection goes up to 20 in some
         brands. Search online and filter by size. They carry Allen Edmonds,
         Cole Haan, and Johnston & Murphy in 17.

      2. **Allen Edmonds** -- Probably your best option for quality dress shoes
         in size 17. They make several models up to 18. The Park Avenue oxford
         is a classic for weddings. Expect to pay $350-450, but they're
         resoleable and will last years.

      3. **Zappos** -- Great filtering by size. They carry multiple brands in
         17, and their return policy is excellent if fit is an issue.

      4. **Oddball Shoes** (oddball.com) -- Specifically caters to sizes 14+.
         They carry dress shoes, casual shoes, and boots. Selection isn't huge
         but everything they stock actually comes in your size.

      5. **New Balance dress shoes** -- Surprisingly, they make a few dress
         and dress-casual models in extended sizes. Worth checking.

      A few tips for the wedding specifically:

      - Order NOW. At size 17, exchanges take longer and you don't want to
        be scrambling the week before.
      - Break them in. New dress shoes in any size need a few wears before
        a long event. Wear them around the house for a week.
      - Consider a cap-toe oxford or a derby -- both are wedding-appropriate
        and tend to look more proportional in larger sizes than loafers.

      What color are you looking for? Black or brown? And is this an outdoor
      or indoor wedding?
  - user: |
      Black, and it's an indoor ceremony and reception. I looked at Allen
      Edmonds but they're a bit out of my budget. Is there anything decent
      in the $100-200 range?
  - assistant: |
      That's a reasonable budget. Here's what I'd look at in that range:

      **Under $150:**
      - Rockport -- They make several models up to size 17 and focus on
        comfort. The Style Leader 2 cap toe is around $110 and is a solid
        choice for a wedding. Not the dressiest option but perfectly
        appropriate.
      - Amazon Essentials / The Drop -- Hit or miss on quality, but some
        of their dress shoes come in 17 for under $60. Read reviews
        carefully. Good as a one-event shoe.

      **$150-200:**
      - Johnston & Murphy -- The Shuler cap-toe oxford comes in 17 and
        runs about $175. Good quality, classic look, comfortable.
      - Florsheim -- Check their Castellano or Montinaro lines. Some
        models go up to 17. Quality is decent for the price.

      **The secret weapon: factory seconds.**
      Allen Edmonds sells factory seconds (minor cosmetic defects) at
      their outlet stores and on shoebank.com for 40-60% off. A $400 shoe
      with a tiny scratch on the sole for $180 is a steal, and at size 17
      the seconds might actually be easier to find since there's less
      demand.

      For an indoor wedding in black, you honestly can't go wrong with any
      plain cap-toe oxford. The people at the wedding won't be inspecting
      your shoes -- they just need to look clean and match your suit.

      When's the wedding? If you have 3-4 weeks, online ordering with
      returns is fine. If it's sooner, I'd hit a Nordstrom Rack or DSW
      in person and see what they have on the shelf in 17.
  - user: |
      Wedding is February 22nd so I have about three weeks. I think I'll
      try the Allen Edmonds factory seconds route first and Nordstrom Rack
      as backup. Thanks for the help!
  - assistant: |
      Good plan! Three weeks is plenty of time for both options. Check
      shoebank.com first -- they list inventory by size so you can see
      immediately what's available in 17. If you find something, they ship
      fast.

      For Nordstrom Rack, call ahead and ask if they have anything in 17
      in black dress shoes. Saves you a trip if they don't. The extended
      size selection varies wildly by location.

      One last thing -- make sure you have black dress socks too. Sounds
      obvious but a lot of guys forget and end up wearing athletic socks
      with dress shoes. Over-the-calf dress socks prevent the dreaded
      "sitting down and showing leg" look.

      Enjoy the wedding!
