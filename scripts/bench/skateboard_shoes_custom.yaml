      I'm ordering custom skate shoes online and I'm paranoid about getting the size wrong.

      I normally wear:
      - Vans Old Skool: US men's 11.5 (snug but OK after break-in)
      - Nike running shoes: US men's 12
      - Dress shoes: usually US 11.5

      The custom shop says their fit is "true to size" but also "narrow at first." What size should I order, and how do I sanity-check at home before I commit?
  - assistant: |
      With your pattern (Vans 11.5, Nike 12, dress 11.5), you are basically in the 11.5-12 range, with width/last shape driving the differences.

      A sensible default for "true to size, narrow at first"
      - Order US men's 11.5 if:
        - You want the skate shoe to feel locked-in
        - You expect some break-in (canvas/leather) and you are OK with snug initially
      - Order US men's 12 if:
        - You are sensitive to forefoot squeeze
        - You plan to wear thicker socks
        - The materials are stiff (heavy leather, reinforced toe) and you do not want a painful break-in

      Home sanity-check (takes 10 minutes)
      1) Measure both feet at end of day:
         - Stand on paper, trace, measure heel-to-toe length.
         - Use the longer foot for decisions.
      2) Check width reality:
         - Measure forefoot circumference (around the ball of the foot) with a tape.
         - Narrow shoes typically bite here first.
      3) Compare to a known reference:
         - If you have a pair of Vans 11.5 that "works," measure the insole length (pull it out if possible).
         - If the custom shop provides insole length in mm, match that.

      Practical risk management
      - If returns are easy: order the size you think (11.5) and plan to exchange if the width pain is immediate.
      - If returns are hard/expensive: lean to 12, then use lacing and an insole to dial in fit.

      Small fit tweaks if you end up between sizes
      - Heel slip: runner's loop lacing, slightly thicker sock.
      - Forefoot tightness: thinner insole, stretch with wear, different lacing pattern to relieve pressure.
  - user: |
      They do allow returns but you have to pay shipping both ways. Any tricks to "try on" without messing them up?
  - assistant: |
      Yes. The goal is to test fit without creating obvious wear.

      Clean try-on protocol
      - Try on indoors only, on a clean surface.
      - Wear the socks you will actually skate in.
      - Keep the laces loose at first, then tighten gradually.

      What to check in the first 2-3 minutes
      - Toe room:
        - You want a small buffer in front of the longest toe.
        - Your toes should not be smashed when you flex forward.
      - Width hot spots:
        - Note any sharp pinch at the ball of the foot; "narrow at first" should feel snug, not painful.
      - Heel hold:
        - A tiny bit of slip is OK at first; persistent lift usually means too big or wrong heel shape.

      Do not do this if you might return
      - No outdoor walking.
      - No skating, no grip tape contact.
      - No bending the shoe aggressively (creases can become "used" evidence).

      If you are still unsure between 11.5 and 12
      - Consider ordering both sizes, do an indoor comparison, return one. It costs extra shipping but reduces the chance you get stuck with the wrong fit.
  - user: |
      If I go with 12, will I lose board feel?
  - assistant: |
      Possibly, but it depends on how much extra internal volume you actually get.

      What affects board feel more than half a size
      - Sole thickness and stiffness
      - Insole thickness (many stock insoles are chunky)
      - Upper material stiffness

      If you size up to 12 and it feels "floaty"
      - Swap to a thinner insole.
      - Use a slightly thicker sock to take up volume without changing sole feel.
      - Use lacing patterns to lock the midfoot down.

      If your Vans 11.5 is already "snug but OK," 11.5 is likely the best board-feel bet, with the main risk being forefoot squeeze if the custom last is truly narrow.
