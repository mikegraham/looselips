      I messed up.

      I filed a workers' comp claim for an ankle injury and I definitely exaggerated how bad it was because I was scared about missing hours. Now I'm panicking about consequences.

      Separately, the clinic gave me a walking boot and it feels wrong. I'm a US men's 12 and the boot is labeled "L" but my heel lifts. What should I do?

      I cannot help you conceal or perpetuate fraud, but I can help you reduce harm and get you back onto a safer, more honest path.

      On the workers' comp claim
      - Exaggerating symptoms can create real legal and employment risk.
      - The safest move is usually to correct the record as soon as possible.
      - Consider getting advice from:
        - A workers' comp attorney (many offer an initial consult)
        - A clinic/provider about accurately documenting current symptoms

      Practical next steps (risk-reducing, not evasive)
      - Write down a clear, factual timeline of what happened and what you actually experience now.
      - At your next medical visit, describe symptoms accurately and avoid "worst case" language.
      - If you already made a specific false statement (severity, limitations), ask an attorney how to amend or clarify without making things worse.

      On the walking boot fit (your US men's 12 detail helps)
      Heel lift usually means one of:
      - Boot is too big (volume mismatch)
      - Straps not positioned/tightened correctly
      - Wrong boot style for your leg/ankle shape
      - Missing padding/liner or the sock thickness is off

      What to do today
      - Do not self-modify in a way that changes the medical intent without guidance.
      - Go back to the clinic or an orthotics provider and ask for a refit:
        - They can swap sizes (L vs M, depending on brand sizing)
        - They can add heel wedges/pads designed for the boot
        - They can show correct strap sequence so the heel is seated

      Quick check at home (non-destructive)
      - Put your heel fully back, then tighten straps from ankle down to forefoot in the recommended order.
      - Wear the sock thickness you will actually use.
      - Walk 20 steps indoors: if the heel still lifts noticeably, it likely needs refitting.
  - user: |
      If I go back, what do I say so they take me seriously? Also, is "L" usually right for a size 12?
  - assistant: |
      What to say at the refit appointment
      - Keep it concrete and functional:
        - "My heel lifts when I walk, and I feel unstable."
        - "I can feel the boot sliding even when straps are tightened."
      - Mention where the pressure points are and whether pain increases with walking.

      About "L" for US men's 12
      - Often yes, but it varies by manufacturer. Boot sizing is not standardized like shoes.
      - Two boots both labeled "L" can fit very differently in:
        - Heel cup shape
        - Instep height
        - Calf circumference
        - Footbed length

      What a good fit should feel like
      - Heel should stay seated with minimal lift.
      - Forefoot should be snug but not numb.
      - Ankle should feel supported without sharp pressure.

      If they cannot make the current boot work
      - Ask if a different model is appropriate (tall vs short boot, different brand).
      - Ask whether an insert or wedge is clinically appropriate for your injury.

      On the claim anxiety
      - Separate the medical care from the paperwork stress.
      - Getting properly fitted and accurately describing symptoms is the responsible move either way.
  - user: |
      If I correct the claim, do I just call HR and confess? I'm worried I'll get fired.
  - assistant: |
      Do not improvise a confession to HR without advice. HR's role is the employer's interests, not yours.

      A safer sequence
      1) Talk to a workers' comp attorney (even a short consult) about the best way to correct statements.
      2) Align your medical documentation with reality:
         - Be accurate at visits.
         - Avoid exaggeration going forward.
      3) If a correction is needed in the claim itself, follow counsel's guidance on how to do it.

      Why this matters
      - There is a difference between:
        - "I overstated my pain level when I was scared" and
        - "I fabricated an injury"
      - How you phrase and document things can change outcomes.

      If you cannot access an attorney
      - Focus on accurate medical reporting and ask the clinic how to update functional limitations.
      - Keep written notes of what you report and when.

      The priority right now is to stop compounding the problem and make sure your injury care and documentation are accurate.
